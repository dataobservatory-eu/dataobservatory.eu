New policy indicators often appear 5-10 years after the year arises. We use the same methodology, and peer-reviewed statistical software to process it, often the same data, that Eurostat would use, but we can create the new indicator…. Now. See our example [100,000 Opinions on the Most Pressing Global Problem](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/post/2021-11-19_global_problem/)." numbered="false" >}}</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/media/img/blogposts_2021/noaa-WWVD4wXRX38-unsplash-edited.png" caption="**Better data**:  Statistical agencies, old fashioned observatories, data providers often do not have the mandate, know-how or resources to improve data quality. Using peer-reviewed statistical software, hundreds of computational tests, we correct mistakes, make correct imputations and forecasts, and we increase the information content of public data by 20-200% percent. This makes the data usable for NGOs, journalist, visual artists who do not have this statistical know-how to make patchy data usable for their application. See our example with the indicator [Government Budget Allocations for R&D in Environment](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/post/2021-11-08-indicator_value_added/)

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/media/img/blogposts_2021/Sisyphus_Bodleian_Library.png" caption="**Easy-to-use data**:  Our data follows the tidy data principle and comes with all the recommended Dublin Core and DataCite metadata. This makes our data particularly easy to open in any spreadsheet application or import into your own database. We publish the data in tabular form, and in JSON form on our API which allows automatic retrieval for heavy users. This is also the best guarantee against repeating the same steps – downloading, changing layout in Excel or OpenOffice or Numbers, removing % signs, properly documenting file versions and their contents (who does that?) and other data processing steps that take up hours and in larger hours thousands of working hours.

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/media/img/blogposts_2021/belgium_flood_risk.jpg" caption="**Big picture**: Integrating and joining data is hard---it requires engineering, mathematical or geo-statistical know-how that most environmental users do not possess. Changing boundaries of French departments, various projections of coordinates on satellite images of land cover, different measurement areas for public opinion and hydrological data, public finance in millions or thousands of euros. We create data that is easy to combine, map, visualize for the end user. See our case study on the severity, awareness of flood risk in Belgium and financial capacity to manage it in our blogpost [data Sisyphus](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/post/2021-07-08-data-sisyphus/)." numbered="false" >}}</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/media/img/belgium_flood_risk.jpg" caption="**Impact**: We publish the data in a way that it is easy to find---as a separate data publication with a DOI, full library information data, placed in open science repositories. Our data is more finable than 99% of the open science data, and therefore makes far bigger impact." numbered="false" >}}</td>
