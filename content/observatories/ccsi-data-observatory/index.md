The creative and cultural sectors and industries are mainly made of networks of freelancers and microenterprises, with very few medium-sized companies. Their economic performance, problems, and innovation capacities hidden. Our open collaboration to create this data observatory is committed to change this. Relying on modern data science, the re-use of open governmental data, open science data, and novel harmonized data collection we aim to fill in the gaps left in the official statistics of the European Union.

We believe that introducing Open Policy Analysis standards with open data, open-source software and research automation can help better understanding how creative people and their enterprises and institutions add value to the European economy, how they create jobs, innovate, and increase the well-being of a diverse European society. Our collaboration is open for individuals, citizens scientists. 

The new observatory can be reached on [ccsi.dataobservatory.eu](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/) and will be institutionally hosted by [IViR](https://www.ivir.nl/), the *Institute for Information Law* of the University of Amsterdam, where Reprex’s co-founder, Daniel Antal will coordinate the development of this new, open scientific tool. Reprex will continue to develop the working model of the data observatory and continue to build open source software tools within the [rOpenGov community](http://ropengov.org/) and the [R-Universe](https://ropengov.r-universe.dev/) initative of ROpenSci.

The [Scuola Superiore di Studi Universitari e di Perfezionamento Sant’Anna](https://www.santannapisa.it/it) and [Università degli Studi di Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en) (Italy); [University of Glasgow](https://www.create.ac.uk/) (United Kingdom); [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://www.ivir.nl/) and [Stichting Europeana](https://pro.europeana.eu/) from the	Netherlands; the [National University of Ireland Maynooth](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/)	(Ireland); [Tartu Ulikool](https://www.ut.ee/en/)	(Estonia); [Szegedi Tudományegyetem](https://u-szeged.hu/) (Hungary); [Fundacion Santa Maria La Real del Patrimonio Historico](https://www.santamarialareal.org/) from Spain; the [Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/),	(Belgium); [Culture Action Europe AISBL](https://cultureactioneurope.org/) and [IDEA Strategische Economische Consulting](https://www.ideaconsult.be/en/) 	(Belgium) and Reprex created the the `RECREO` consortium, which will mainly develop new policy evidence in the field of innovation and inclusiveness for the creative and cultural sectors, industries. The Consortium applies for a Horizon Europe grant with the `HORIZON-CL2-2021-HERITAGE-01-03` [Cultural and creative industries as a driver of innovation and competitiveness](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl2-2021-heritage-01-03) call of the European Commission.
